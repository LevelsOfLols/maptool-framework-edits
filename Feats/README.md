## Reminder
**feats.json** is where all the classes, features, backgrounds and races go (Sub races are their own entry that needs to be fully detailed out adding on top of the main class, remember that!
**additionalfeats.json** is where the choice options need to go. Follow the examples if you need it.
SRD is already included so you can work off of that and no, they don't need to be alphabetically organized
