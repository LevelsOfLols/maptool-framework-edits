# maptool-framework-edits
A place for me and hopefully others that can help can edit jsons for use with rtakehara's 5e framework in maptool. 
## How to help
Classes, Race, Backgrounds, Subclasses, class features get put in the feats folder.
Spells go in the spells folder.

In the folder you'll find a JSON, which you can contribute to in your branch if you have a github account. Alternatively, there are template text files that you can fill out and send to me so i can just add them.
**If the class/subclass you are working on has options you need to choose from (For example Metamagic options), they need to be added in the additional feats json**
